My solutions to the problems in *Eloquent JavaScript*, 3rd Edition, by Marijn Haverbeke. In all cases I have worked on these issues without reference to the solutions, although I do eventually read the solutions to compare implementations (once tests pass) and on occasion have revised my solutions for clarity.
